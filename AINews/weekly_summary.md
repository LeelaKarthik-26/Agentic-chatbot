# Weekly AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, let's start by looking at the user's query. They want me to summarize AI-related news articles into a markdown format with specific details. The key points are: date in yyyy-mm-dd EST, concise summaries, sorted by date (latest first), and source URLs as links. 

First, I need to parse each article's content. The user provided multiple articles with dates, content, and URLs. The challenge is to extract the relevant information accurately. 

Starting with the first article: The US imposing visa bans on European leaders over tech regulations. The date given is 2025-12-24. I need to check if the date is in EST. Since the date is from 2025-12-24 12:06:50 GMT, converting to EST would subtract 4 hours, making the date still 2025-12-24. The summary should mention the visa bans, the leaders involved, and the reason (tech regulations). The URL is provided, so that's straightforward.

Next, the Tuya Smart article. Date is 2025-12-25 GMT. Converting to EST would be 2025-12-24, since GMT is UTC and EST is UTC-5. Wait, no—GMT is UTC. So 09:18 GMT on the 25th is 04:18 EST, which is still the same day in EST. So the date remains 2025-12-25. The summary should highlight the launch of Hey Tuya and its features like the Physical AI Engine.

Fox News AI Newsletter from December 19, 2025. The date is 14:49:03 GMT. Converting to EST would be 09:49 EST, same day. Summary needs to cover the blue-collar productivity boom, Palantir's CTO comments, and the Trump initiative on technical talent.

The AI Statecraft article from Mediapost is dated 01:50:34 GMT. Converting to EST is 20:50 EST on 22nd, so the date remains 2025-12-22. The summary should focus on AI policy concerns like privacy and freedom of expression.

New York's RAISE Act is from 06:05:15 GMT. Converting to EST is 01:05 EST on 21st, so date is 2025-12-21. The summary should mention the new AI safety regulations under Hochul.

The TechCrunch Disrupt article about agtech and food tech startups from 2025-12-24. The date is 18:08:53 GMT, which is 13:08 EST. Still the same date. The summary needs to highlight the 14 top startups featured.

Investors focus on AI startups from 2025-12-20. The GMT date is 00:10:27, converting to EST is 19:10 on 19th. The summary should cover investor interest at TechCrunch Disrupt.

Small Business Technology News from 2025-12-21. The date is 12:00:00 GMT, which becomes 07:00 EST. Summary includes points like Google's chatbot accuracy and Zoom's AI companion.

Amazon's Zoox recall article from 2025-12-23. The GMT date is 09:04:25, converting to EST is 04:04, same day. Summary mentions the software issue leading to a recall.

Lastly, Bloomberg Law's article on AI and law from 2025-12-23. The GMT time is 09:30:06, converting to EST is 04:30, so date remains. The summary should discuss the Trump executive order and state AI laws.

Now, I need to sort all these by date, latest first. Let's list the dates:

- 2025-12-25 (Tuya)
- 2025-12-24 (US Visa bans)
- 2025-12-24 (TechCrunch Disrupt)
- 2025-12-23 (Zoox recall)
- 2025-12-23 (Bloomberg Law)
- 2025-12-22 (AI Statecraft)
- 2025-12-21 (New York RAISE Act)
- 2025-12-21 (Small Business News)
- 2025-12-20 (Investors focus)
- 2025-12-19 (Fox News)

I need to ensure that the dates are in EST. For each article, the original GMT date is given, and converting to EST. For example, the US Visa article is 12:06 GMT on 24th, which is 07:06 EST, same day. So the date remains 2025-12-24. The TechCrunch Disrupt article is 18:08 GMT on 24th, which is 13:08 EST, so same date. 

Now, compiling all the summaries with correct dates and ordering them from latest to earliest. Checking each date again to avoid mistakes. Then, formatting them into markdown with the specified structure. Each entry starts with ### [Date], followed by bullet points with the summary and URL. Need to make sure URLs are correctly linked and the summaries are concise, capturing the main points without extra fluff.
